            <p>We realize that we are in your house and do our best to keep out of your way. We are sticklers for keeping a clean, tidy and safe jobsite. Before hiring all of our employees pass drug tests and background checks.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We do many “Out of the ordinary” projects. Generally, we do our own demolition, excavation, concrete work, framing, interior and exterior trim, pretty much anything involving carpentry and depending on the complexity and how busy we are we will do our own electrical, plumbing, drywall and painting.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We do as much of our work “In House” as we can, limiting sub contractors and thus having a higher level of control over quality and schedule. The sub-contractors we do use are also licensed, bonded and insured. Most of the sub-contractors that we do use have been with us for many years, some for decades.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On projects requiring building permits we can do all of the interaction with the City/County including pre-project planning, the permitting process, inspections, etc.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On projects that call for drawings we can work with your designer or architect or with a professional designer on staff (a former building inspector) we can create the dream design and drawings for your project in house at a fraction of the cost of bringing in an outside designer or architect. We have a good working relationship with several engineers and other construction industry professionals as well. We are also happy to work with your drawings if you are already to that stage of your project.</p>
